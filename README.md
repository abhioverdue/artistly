#Artistly Frontend


Artistly.com is designed for Event Planners and Artist Managers to connect. Event planners
can browse through artist profiles, shortlist their preferences, and raise booking/availability
requests. Artist Managers can onboard artists, receive booking leads, and manage responses
via a dashboard.
The actual backend and database logic is out of scopeâ€”for now, use static JSON files or mock
APIs. Focus entirely on frontend engineering quality using React + Next.js, with best
practices in routing, responsiveness, UI rendering, and folder structure.
